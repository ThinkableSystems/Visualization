Visualization
=============

Tool for doing visualization in javascript

Once you have git installed on your machine, in you terminal, go to your eclipse work space folder and type in 

git clone git@github.com:ThinkableSystems/Visualization.git

This should put the visualization software on your machine.

You should be able to open eclipse and start tooling around with it.

If something goes horribly wrong and you cannot get the code back to its working state, you can close eclipse, go to the 
Visualization folder in you terminal, and type

git reset --hard

This will take the application back to the initials state

Finally here is a really really good hands on training site for Git
